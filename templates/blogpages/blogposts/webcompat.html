						<code>Webcompat</code>, is one of the recent interests that i find myself
						occupied with. The community is wonderful and the whole idea of having a
						place where users can report problems is quite fantastic. I believe that
						this can evolve as something greater, since <code>webcompat.com</code> is
						not only a website that focusses on bug reporting and problems, since i
						believe that it is a common ecosystem where users, developers and site owners
						are	notified with the issues on the web.
						</p>

						<p>
						<b>How did it all start ?</b>
						<br />
						I am grateful to Dietrich for introducing me to this community which i find
						myself most related to, besides i always have this perception that if a volunteer
						or contributor is connected to the core idea of the community then he/she can
						relate to the project easily. So after getting a sense of what this community is
						all about I rushed to <code>webcompat's</code> repo on github and started solving
						issues and submitting patches. The entire community of <code>webcompat</code> is
						very helpful and I know i shouldn't specify names since all offered their support
						equally but I have to thank Mike Taylor for helping me submit correct patches and
						understand the idea of how stuff works with <code>webcompat</code>.
						</p>

						<p>
						<b>Where did you involve ?</b>
						<br />
						I find myself occupied writing code, so i wanted to contribute to the codebase
						of <code>webcompat</code>. There is a repo named <code>webcompat-reporter-extension
						</code> which I contributed to the most. So the repo is all about browser extensions
						(firefox, chrome, opera, safari). The idea is basically to add a reporter extension
						to the browser so that reporting bugs, issues can be made easy. So i submitted four
						patches till now for the browser-extensions repo.
						<ul>
							<li><a href="https://github.com/webcompat/webcompat-reporter-extensions/pull/30" target="_blank">Patch 1</a></li>
							<li><a href="https://github.com/webcompat/webcompat-reporter-extensions/pull/32" target="_blank">Patch 2</a></li>
							<li><a href="https://github.com/webcompat/webcompat-reporter-extensions/pull/37" target="_blank">Patch 3</a></li>
							<li><a href="https://github.com/webcompat/webcompat-reporter-extensions/pull/38" target="_blank">Patch 4</a></li>
						</ul>
						</p>

						<p>
						<b>What made me contribute ?</b>
						<br />
						It first started when <code>web.whatsapp.com</code> was launched and the firefox wasn't
						supported to have that feature. It prompted me a message saying browser not supported. Then
						i got this feeling that what if there is a website that reported all such incidents;
						voila! <code>webcompat.com</code>. Now as soon as i saw the project in detail and understood
						what it is all about, i felt that this is not only a website that just gives all the bug
						reports of the websites that are broken, but it is a platform that is actually helping to
						establish the thought of having websites work across the web. Be it any device, browser etc
						fundamentally all operate over the web, there is no point if they don't work across everywhere.
						So this broader thought acted as a catalyst in helping me to contribute to this project.
						</p>

						<p>
						<b>Interested ? Want to contribute ?</b>
						<br />
						Before you rush, If you feel the same as <code><a href="https://webcompat.com/about">webcompat.com/about</a></code>
						then please go ahead start contributing in which ever way you can. There are various ways to contribute, choose
						where you'd want to. The community can be reached out on <code>irc.mozilla.org</code> under the channel <code>
						#webcompat</code>
						</p>

						<p>
						It has been wonderful being part of this community and i look forward to
						contribute more in every possible way i can.
						</p>

						<p>
							Thats it folks, <br>
							<code>Happy Hacking !!</code>
