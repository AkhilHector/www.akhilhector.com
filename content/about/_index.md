I am Akhil Pandey, I'm a Ph.D student working on addressing the [*Reproducibility crisis in AI*](https://www.science.org/doi/full/10.1126/science.359.6377.725?casa_token=B4RgaLsweT0AAAAA%3AsuAiGo_9E7o0T0WkRQPxEQVn3-X9edRZ8OatwAxM2YEifI-S2bGXYNtTwNdRDg38zqEVTqBhLYe1SfE). I am advised by [Dr. Hamed Alhoori](https://alhoori.github.io/), and my research is fully funded by the [NSF grant](https://www.nsf.gov/awardsearch/showAward?AWD_ID=2022443&HistoricalAwards=false). I mostly work on Positive Unlabeled Learning, Graph Learning, AutoML, Uncertainty Quantification, and Computational Linguistics. I have closely worked under the supervision of [Dr. Prasanna Balaprakash](https://pbalapra.github.io/) from [Argonne National Laboratory](https://www.anl.gov/) as an [ALCF summer student](https://www.alcf.anl.gov/alcf-student-opportunities), and a [Givens Associate](https://www.anl.gov/mcs/givens-associates) to solve Graph Learning Problems. I have given a workshop on using AutoML for Graph Neural Architecture Search, available at [ALCF DeepHyper Automated Machine Learning Workshop](https://deephyper.github.io/events/workshop-anl-2022-summer).

I am an Open Source Enthusiast and in the past I had the opportunity to represent `mozilla` and `webcompat` communities. I enjoy capturing random objects, candid moments and vivid terrains. I am [peredepain](https://www.instagram.com/peredepain/) on Instagram. I'm available for email at `akhilpandey95@icloud.com` or `aakella@niu.edu`

I was a speaker at [FOSSASIA 2016, Singapore](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iUoCGXDjvvQ). Google Summer of Code 2016 Student.
