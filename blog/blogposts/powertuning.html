						<p>
							I always used to find myself in a difficult situation when i had to travel
							and work. The main reason for this is my machine had a <code>GNU/Linux</code>
							based distro running and i couldn't stay away from a charging spot for more than
							two hours. I always was intrigued to explore this segment and solve this very problem
							in order to better my travel experience.
						</p>

						<p>
						 Basically there are couple of things to be kept in mind before you go out and try
						 the tricks mentioned here, Consider them basics; So they are :
						 <ul>
							 	<li>The Kernel plays a major role in providing support to enhance battery life.
								So i have tested the battery saving hacks on kernel's :
									<ul>
										<li><code>4.2.x</code></li>
										<li><code>4.2.x</code></li>
										<li><code>4.7*</code>// Arch</li>
									</ul>
								So make sure you have kernel above <code>4.x.x</code> as they show a significant
								improvement with latest set of processors
								</li>
								<li>Apart from the kernel the next major role is played by the distro, so it is very
								important to have a desktop environment that is not bloated will unecessary software.
								For example LXDE, Xfce, Xmonad, OpenBox are the options you might want to look at if you
								are keen on battery and minimalism</li>
								<li>The distro comes next, you might think that having a light weight Desktop environment
								will do your job, although your job is only halfdone. So in order to complete the list of
							  basics you must ensure that you have a light weight Distro like Arch Linux, Arch Bang,
							  Xubuntu, Lubuntu. Don't expect these hacks to work properly on Unity, Gnome</li>
						 </ul>
						</p>

						<p>
						<b>My setup :</b>
						<br />
						I basically use <code>Arch linux + XFCE</code> with the latest kernel;
<pre style="background-color: #666; border-radius: 10px;">
<code style="color: white;" class="shell">
Linux machine 4.7.2-1-ARCH #1 SMP PREEMPT Sat Aug 20 23:02:56 CEST 2016 x86_64 GNU/Linux
</code>
</pre>
						</p>

						<p>
						Things to be installed before starting this:
						<br />
						<b>For Arch</b>
<pre style="background-color: #666; border-radius: 10px;">
<code style="color: white;" class="shell">
pacman -S tlp
pacman -S powertop
pacman -S intel-ucode
pacman -S yaourt
yaourt thermald
</code>
</pre>
						<br />
						<b>For *buntu</b>
<pre style="background-color: #666; border-radius: 10px;">
<code style="color: white;" class="shell">
apt-get install tlp
apt-get install powertop
# Thermald is installed by default in *buntu based distro's
</code>
</pre>
						</p>

						<p>
						Before i start let me just say couple of things which are to be kept in
						mind whilst copying/pasting the commands listed in the article.
						<ul>
							<li>There might be a command which might not be suitable to your machine
							or your hardware in specific, so kindly read about the same before you
						  unleash your fingers</li>
							<li>Some of these commands might be very handy or might be not at all,
							since we have to take many things like kernel support etc into consideration
						  and also rather than having a thought that this would be mind-blowingexpect
							the outcome to be mildly good.</li>
							<li>If you are new to GNU/Linux please make sure that you have a reference by
							your side whilst going through this article.</li>
						</ul>
						</p>

						<p>
						<b>Let's get started :</b>
						<br />
						 So considering that you have installed the afore mentioned packages, let's
						 get started:
						 <br />
						 <br />

						 <b>Aspect 1 : <code>brightness</code></b>
						 <br />
						 Although you might have the feeling that you know this thing from a long time,
						 there are some things to ensure that you use this method the right way. So open
						 the terminal and type :
<pre style="background-color: #666; border-radius: 10px;">
<code style="color: white;" class="shell">
cat /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/brightness
</code>
</pre>
						Typing the above command gives you the brightness which your screen is currently
						set to, now go ahead and type:
<pre style="background-color: #666; border-radius: 10px;">
<code style="color: white;" class="shell">
cat /sys/class/backlight/intel_backlight/max_brightness
</code>
</pre>
						Typing the above command gives you the maximum brightness that can be set to your
						machine. So now the important part to be noted here is, make sure that your current
						brightness is set to nearly <code>8.5%</code> of your maximum brightness. Making sure
						that you set this to that value you can increase the battery time invariably.
						<br />
						<br />

						<b>Aspect 2: <code>Events & Services</code></b>
						<br />
						The next important part of the process is using the services which system wants and
						removing the things which are not necessary. So things like <code>bluetooth, mongodb,
						mysql, rethinkdb, etc....</code> could be disabled. Note that the idea here is not about
						disabling a specific service or distinguishing them, although it is basically about stopping
						all the unwanted services. Turn them off by typing
<pre style="background-color: #666; border-radius: 10px;">
<code style="color: white;" class="shell">
# Arch linus
systemctl --failed --all
systemctl stop service_name

# Ubuntu based distros
service service_name stop
</code>
</pre>
						Make sure that cursor blink mode is disabled, since this event is responsible for
						consuming a significant amount of power. Type the following command :
<pre style="background-color: #666; border-radius: 10px;">
<code style="color: white;" class="shell">
# Any distro doesn't matter
gconftool-2 --type string --set /apps/gnome-terminal/profiles/Default/cursor_blink_mode off
</code>
</pre>
						The above command <code>gconftool-2</code> is basically a configuration tool for
						changing the default values in a system. All the preferences are basically key:value
						pairs. Typing the above command the cursor blinking mod is turned off.
						<br />
						<br />

						<b>Aspect 3 : <code>Screensaver and display manager</code></b>
						</p>

						<p>
							Thats it folks, <br>
							<code>Happy Hacking !!</code>
