							In the process of exploring beautiful locations in and around Vizag
							I had an oppurtunity to visit Lambasingi which is a scenic magnifico
							located at 120-130 Kms from the city of Visakhapatnam, Andhra Pradesh.
							<br>
							I wanted to have a raw essence of travel as a result me and my pack
							decided to visit this place on bike. It is pretty much a decent distance
							to visit on bike, it might nearly take 4 hours to commute from Visakhapatnam.
						</p>
						<p>
							In addition to this there is one more location near Lambasingi called <a href="https://www.google.co.in/search?q=paderu">Paderu</a>. In order to witness those pictures Do <a href="https://www.instagram.com/the_alphaeye/">Check out.</a>

							<p>
								“When one is gifted with the opportunity of experiencing such scenic
								magnificence, then one tends to burst into ecstasy for each & every
								moment that which has been experienced and remains stoned for some time.”

							You have to roll up your sleeves and be a stonecutter before you
							can become a sculptor – command of craft always precedes art:
							apprentice, journeyman, master. <br>
							It doesn’t matter one damn bit whether fashion is art or not. You
							don’t question whether an incredible chef is an artist or not – his
							cakes are delicious and that’s all that matters.
						</p>
						<p>
							If you want to set off and go develop some grand new thing, you
							don’t need millions of dollars of capitalization. You need enough pizza
							and Diet Coke to stick in your refrigerator, a cheap PC to work on and
							the dedication to go through with it.
						</p>
						<p>
							Well you’re in your little room and you’re working on something
							good but if it’s really good you’re gonna need a bigger room and when
							you’re in the bigger room you might not know what to do you might have
							to think of how you got started sitting in your little room.

							Chances are, unless I’m a designer, I don’t know what I want. All
							I know is I want something functional that looks good, is comparable
							with my competitors, and features constant colour schemes for branding.
						</p>
						<p>
							I’ll look at other designs that have already been created and ask
							for something similar. Hence, it is important that you can take the
							information I give and help me visualize what it is you
						</p>
						<p>
							I want everything we do to be beautiful. I don’t give a damn
							whether the client understands that that’s worth anything, or that the
							client thinks it’s worth anything, or whether it is worth anything. It’s
							worth it to me. It’s the way I want to live my life. I want to make
							beautiful things, even if nobody cares.
						</p>

							The place also gave me an oppurtunity to explore the vivid landscapes,
							lush green sprawling fields, and also a lake. Apart from clicking the
							landscapes, I also felt lucky to witness the picturesque villages.
