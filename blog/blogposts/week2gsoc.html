							Before breaking it down, to all those who don't know what REST API's are :
							<br>
							<br>
							"REST is acronym for REpresentational State Transfer. It is architectural style for distributed hypermedia systems ans was first presented by Roy Fielding in 2000 in his famous dissertation."
							<small>Source : "restfulapi.net"</small>
						</p>
						<br>
						<b>So what is a Promise ?</b>
						<p>
							Generally promises are representation of a value that which might not be available to us as of now
							but at some point eventually it will be available. Observe the below image to understand how promises
							work.
						</p>
						<p>

						</p>
						<br>
						<b>So how is this better than callbacks ?</b>
						<p>
							Generally if you are using callbacks in your codebase then at some point of time either for i/o's or file buffers or
							something might come in your way and makes you write nested callbacks. Writing nested callbacks is difficult and an
							alternative to that is <code>promise</code>
						</p>
						<p>

						</p>
						<b>REST API's, promises what are you about to explain ?</b>
						<p>
							Angular has this beautiful service called <code>$q</code> which is helpful for creating promises and using them in
							your angular applications. Generally many people have concerns over <code>$q</code> but <code>$q</code> is tightly
							integrated with the scope life cycle. So be it any task it contains all the necessary features needed by most of the
							heavy duty asynchronous tasks.
						</p>
						<p>
							Now to start off angular can be really powerfull with the <code>$http</code> Service provided the fact that it has
							immense potential in allowing us to create heavy duty REST ful API's, CRUD operation based web applications etc. So
							let us understand the $http service first before using promises for creating a REST ful API.
							<br>
							<hr>
							<code>
								$http<br>
								&nbsp;  |_____ .success()<br>
								         &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <small>For a success(), callback is called asynchronously when the request completes and the
								  response arrives from the server</small>  <br>
								&nbsp;  |_____ .error()<br>
										&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <small>For an error(), the error callback is fired</small>
							</code>
							<hr>
							Callbacks which are accpeted by above methods are :
							<ul>
								<li>data: It is a response obtained from server.</li>
								<li>status: HTTP status codes 100x, 200x, 300x, 400x, etc which returned from server.</li>
								<li>config: Object used for generating the request.</li>
								<li>headers: Headers sent by the server.</li>
								<li>statusText: HTTP status text of the status code.</li>
							</ul>
						</p>
						<b>Promise Chaining</b>
						<p>
							Chaining is one of the most important aspects of promises. Here the basic idea is that promises can be composed
							through chaining. This means you can trigger a specified task only after previous promise has been resolved.
						</p>
						<b>Handling errors by designing a promise that always rejects</b>
						<p>No API is complete without writing a handler or a middleware that takes care of all the requests which are generally
						errored. Designing this will be useful if we want to tell a user about the occurrence of an error in terms of a promise rather than
						a simple value.</p>
						<p>
							<img src="../img/week2gsoc4.jpg">
						</p>
						<p>
							NOTE : Generally while using <code>$http</code> Service there are somethings which one should have knowledge
							of, If we happen to send a JS object as POST data in a POST/PUT request, it's serialized to JSON before getting sent.
							Similarly, if the server responds with a JSON string it's parsed into a JavaScript object and passed to the success callback attached to the promise.
						</p>
						<p>
							Thats it folks, <br>
							<code>Happy Hacking !!</code>
